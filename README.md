## ⚠️ Unmaintained
I am no longer a user of intra.42.fr, therefore I can no longer maintain this extension.

# ft_logtime
A simple extension for Firefox and Chrome that sums up the daily hours of log time of a user at [https://intra.42.fr](https://intra.42.fr) and shows the sum of each month in their *Logtime* section of the profile.
The sum is updated every time the page is reloaded.
